# minesweeper

A game similar to minesweeper where the player must input a certain number of co-ordinates without landing on a bomb. Each coordinate reveals a number indicating the number of bombs surrounding that cell. Landing on a bomb at this stage is game over.

After using all their guesses the game enters a new stage where the player must guess the cordinates of each bomb. Entering cordinates that don't contain a bomb is game over.

The player can change the difficulty by choose how many bombs are in the grid and can choose to be given two clues at the beginning of the game.
